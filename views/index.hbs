    Welcome to Golden Eagles Dealership Database. Golden Eagles (GE) auto dealership offers various selection of vehicles ‚Äì sedans, SUVs, trucks, sports cars, and e-vehicles. This database keeps track of their vehicle inventory, their sales, their employees, and most importantly, their customers. Since their sales revenue has gone up from 1 million to 5.5 million per year selling roughly 2,000 vehicles annually, GE wants to keep track of invoices to properly account for revenue and growth. The goal is to design a well-organized database system to drive the sales transactions, to track their vehicle inventory in real time, to pick the best selling sales employee of the month, and to keep the good clientele flow by offering discounts to returning customers. </p>
