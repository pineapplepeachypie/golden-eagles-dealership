# Database for Golden Eagles Dealership
This project is a database for a fictional auto dealership called Golden Eagles Dealership. The database includes 5 entities and 5 relationships
as well as 1 Many-to-Many relationship. The entities are customers, employees, vehicles, vehicle specifications, statuses, and 
vehicle sales. Select and Insert functiionality is available to all the tables, Update and Delete are available to customers, employees, and 
vehicle sales as well. Vehicle sales acts as the intersection table that facilitates the M:M relationship between customers and employees. Deletion 
or updating from the customers, employees, or vehicle sales tables do not create data anomalies to the related tables. 

SQL queries were written to support all CRUD functionalities, and javascript code is written on the server side and fron-end.
